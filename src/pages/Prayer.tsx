  اللَّهُمَّ يَا مُنْتَهَى كُلِّ نَجْوَى، وَيَا سَامِعَ كُلِّ شَكْوَى، يَا نَاصِرَ الْمَظْلُومِينَ، وَيَا رَاحِمَ الضُّعَفَاءِ وَالمَسَاكِينِ، ٱنْصُرْ إِخْوَانَنَا الْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي كُلِّ مَكَانٍ، وَخَاصَّةً غَزَّةَ وَفِلَسْطِين، يَا أَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِينَ
    
  اللَّهُمَّ دَاوِ جَرْحَاهُمْ، وَٱشْفِ مَرْضَاهُمْ، وَأَطْعِمْ جَوْعَاهُمْ، وَاسْقِ عَطْشَاهُمْ، وَادْفِئْ بَرْدَاهُمْ، يَا رَبَّ الْعَالَمِينَ. اللَّهُمَّ إِنَّهُمْ حُفَاةٌ فَاحْمِلْهُمْ، وَعُرَاةٌ فَاكْسُهُمْ، وَمَظْلُومُونَ فَانْصُرْهُمْ، يَا مُغِيثَ المُسْتَغِيثِينَ
    
  اللَّهُمَّ زَمِّلْهُم بِرَحْمَتِكَ، وَأَسْكِنْهُمْ بِمَوَدَّتِكَ، وَقَوِّهِمْ بِقُوَّتِكَ، وَثَبِّتْهُمْ بِعِزَّتِكَ. اللَّهُمَّ ٱحْفَظْهُمْ مِنْ كُلِّ جَبَّارٍعَنِيدٍ، وَأَبْعِدْهُمْ مِنْ كُلِّ ظَلَّامٍ لِلْعَبِيدِ. اللَّهُمَّ ٱجْعَلْ جَمِيعَ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْنًا، وَجَمِيعَ هَمِّهِمْ فَرَجًا، وَجَمِيعَ ضِيْقِهِمْ مَخْرَجًا، وَجَمِيعَ حُزْنِهِمْ فَرَحًا، يَا رَبَّ الْعَالَمِينَ
  
  رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً، وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً، وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ`,

    translation: `Ya Allah, bestow upon us on this day a supplication that will not be rejected, and open for us a door in Paradise that will not be shut. Gather us in the company of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). 
  
  Ya Allah, make the best of Your creation beloved to us, and from the 'hawdh' (pond) of Your Prophet, quench us. In Your Paradise, grant us refuge. With Your mercy, envelop us; grant us our wishes; enrich us with Your bounty; guide us to Your obedience; protect us from the punishment of the Fire and suffice us against the evil of every envier.
  
  Ya Allah, the One who hears every plea and listens to every complaint, the Supporter of the oppressed, the Merciful to the weak and the needy — aid our oppressed brothers and sisters everywhere, especially in Gaza and Palestine, O Most Merciful of the merciful.
  
  Ya Allah, heal their wounds, cure their sick, feed their hungry, quench their thirst, warm their cold. O Lord of the Worlds, they are barefoot — carry them; unclothed — clothe them; oppressed — support them. O Helper of the helpless.
  
  Ya Allah, envelop them in Your mercy, calm them with Your love, strengthen them with Your power, and make them firm with Your might. 
  
  Ya Allah, protect them from every stubborn tyrant, and distance them from every oppressor of Your servants. Turn all their fear into safety, their worries into ease, their hardship into relief, and their sorrow into joy. O Lord of the Worlds.
  
  Our Lord, grant us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.`,
  description: "A profoundly encompassing prayer that begins with a plea for Paradise and ends with healing, provision, protection, and victory for the oppressed in Gaza and beyond. This du’a weaves together hope for the Hereafter with urgent cries for relief in this world. It reflects both personal longing for nearness to the Prophet ﷺ and collective solidarity with the wounded, the displaced, the hungry, and the forgotten. A powerful invocation that wraps the heart of Palestine in mercy, dignity, and divine intervention."
